# Fashion-MNIST

 *Keras*  includes a data set similar to MNIST called Fashion-MNIST. It's a collection of small images of clothing, such as t-shirts, sandals, sneakers and so on. Here I have trained my model to predict the image with reliable accuracy and less variance.
I have used Tensorflow 2.0.
